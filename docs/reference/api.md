# API Reference

This page is auto-generated from Protocol Buffer definitions during the documentation build.

!!! note "Build-time Generation"
    The full API documentation is generated by `protoc-gen-doc` from the `.proto` files
    in the `proto/` directory. If you're viewing this placeholder, the documentation
    has not yet been built.

    Run `./scripts/generate-proto-docs.sh` to generate the API documentation locally.
