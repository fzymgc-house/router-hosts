# ============================================================================
# ACTION SELECTION RATIONALE
# ============================================================================
# This workflow uses snok/container-retention-policy instead of the official
# actions/delete-package-versions action for the following reasons:
#
# 1. UNSUPPORTED PARAMETERS IN OFFICIAL ACTION:
#    - actions/delete-package-versions@v5 does NOT support:
#      - `older-than`: Time-based retention (we need 7 days)
#      - `version-pattern`: Regex filtering (we need to target SHA tags)
#      - `dry-run`: Safe testing mode
#    - These parameters are silently ignored, making the workflow ineffective
#
# 2. ALTERNATIVE ACTION EVALUATION:
#    - snok/container-retention-policy@v3.0.1:
#      ✓ Supports time-based retention via `cut-off`
#      ✓ Supports dry-run mode
#      ✓ Active maintenance (235 stars, commits within last month)
#      ✓ Issues get resolved promptly
#      ✓ Clean, focused feature set
#
#    - dataaxiom/ghcr-cleanup-action (REJECTED):
#      ✗ Critical bugs in core features (issues #99, #101)
#      ✗ No maintainer response for 2+ months
#      ✗ Last release 11 months ago
#      ✗ Shows signs of abandonment
#
# 3. TRADE-OFFS AND WORKAROUNDS:
#    - snok does NOT support regex pattern matching for tag selection
#    - Workaround: Use `image-tags` to explicitly protect production tags
#    - Unprotected tags (SHA-based dev images) are cleaned by `cut-off`
#    - See docs/workarounds/ghcr-cleanup.md for detailed explanation
#
# ============================================================================
# PRE-RELEASE TAG PROTECTION
# ============================================================================
# The protected tag list below covers:
# - 'latest' tag
# - Basic semver tags (v1.0.0, v0.5.0)
# - Pre-release tags (v1.0.0-beta.1, v1.0.0-rc.2)
#
# NOTE: Build metadata tags (v1.0.0+build.123) are NOT protected.
# If you use build metadata in production, add them to `image-tags`.
