# Pre-commit hooks for router-hosts
# Install: pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
# Run manually: pre-commit run --all-files
# Run all stages: pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage pre-push
#
# Hooks are ordered by speed (fast checks first) for fail-fast behavior.
# Expensive checks (clippy) run only on pre-push stage.
# Tests run in ci.yml workflow, not pre-commit (avoids CI duplication).
