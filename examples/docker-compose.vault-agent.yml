# Router-Hosts with Vault Agent for Automated Certificate Management
#
# This setup uses HashiCorp Vault Agent to:
#   - Automatically fetch server certificates from Vault PKI
#   - Renew certificates before expiration
#   - Deliver CA certificate for client validation
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Vault PKI configured (run setup-vault-pki.sh)
#   2. AppRole or other auth method configured for Vault Agent
#   3. Create vault-agent-config.hcl from template
#
# Usage:
#   cp vault-agent-config.hcl.example vault-agent-config.hcl
#   # Edit vault-agent-config.hcl with your Vault details
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.vault-agent.yml up -d
#
# For client certificates, use generate-certs-vault.sh or configure
# a separate Vault Agent on the client machine.
