# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-07)

**Core value:** Declare a hostname once — the router's authoritative DNS output stays correct, leak-free, and hands-off.
**Current focus:** Phase 07 — gateway-api-support

## Current Position

Phase: 07 (gateway-api-support) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 6
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-26 — Phase 07 execution started

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 6 phases shipped pre-GSD (no per-plan timing captured)
- Average duration: n/a (retrospective baseline)
- Total execution time: n/a

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1–6 (shipped) | shipped | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last shipped release: v0.10.13
- Trend: Stable (mature, in-production)

*Updated after each plan completion*
**Per-Plan Metrics:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 07 P01 | 40min | 4 tasks | 6 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md (Key Decisions table + Locked Decisions ADR blocks).
Load-bearing locked decisions affecting current/forward work:

- **router-hosts-bzg** (LOCKED): unbound per-name `local-zone static` — Phase 5 output constraint
- **router-hosts-v5b / -vl8 / -4w2** (LOCKED): compaction via HostCompacted seed, manual scope, GetAtTime sacrificed — Phase 6
- **Rust → Go migration (2026-02-22)**: current stack is Go/SQLite-only; Rust-era Service-controller design was never ported (Phase 8 gap)
- [Phase ?]: D-09 confirmed at plan checkpoint: single gatewayCleanupFinalizer (router-hosts.fzymgc.house/gateway-cleanup) shared across all three Gateway API route kinds, not per-kind finalizers

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **[Phase 7]**: Gateway API is design-only (Draft, 2026-06-07) — no `gateway-api` dependency or controller in the Go operator; net-new implementation.
- **[Phase 8]**: Service controller exists only as superseded Rust-era design; must be built fresh in Go.
- **[Codebase]**: `service.go` (1033 LOC) and `commands.go` (519 LOC) are merge hotspots; in-tree `legacy_migration.go` is a permanent maintenance surface pending a removal milestone.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Storage/History | Snapshot tables + auto-compaction (v2 HIST-01/02) | Deferred (YAGNI, ADR vl8) | 2026-07-07 |
| Maintainability | Remove Rust-era `legacy_migration.go` (v2 DEBT-01) | Deferred | 2026-07-07 |
